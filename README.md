This project involved creating and deploying a simple contract called `HelloWorld`.
Inside the contract are functions to set and retrieve a message, as well as transfer contract ownership and is very basic for homework reasons.
This project demonstrates basic Solidity programming where smart contract deployment using Remix and MetaMask was used for interaction with the contract on the Sepolia testnet.
